# What have we covered in tutorial #1 

We introduced a few concepts that are commonly used when developing an ember app.

We started by giving a brief overview on an ember app structure (https://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#folder-layout and https://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#layout-within-app-directory) using ember-cli. Remember ember-cli is not the same as ember.

Then we started talking about the development of a simple ember app where we introduced a few concepts in a simple manner: 
- Routing https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.7.0/routing/
- Templates https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.7.0/templates/handlebars-basics/
- Components  https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.7.0/components/defining-a-component/
- Addons https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.7.0/addons-and-dependencies/managing-dependencies/

We also deployed the ember app to heroku https://github.com/tonycoco/heroku-buildpack-ember-cli
